| `2a`      | **Node Failure Detected (Simulated)** | The moment the node hosting the pod is forcefully stopped (e.g., via `docker stop` or machine shutdown), simulating a node crash or hardware failure. | Establishes the **starting point** of the failure sequence.                     |
| `3a`      | **New Pod Scheduled**                 | The timestamp when the Kubernetes scheduler **assigns the new replacement pod** to a healthy node after detecting the original node has failed.       | Measures the **controller reaction time** and **scheduler responsiveness**.     |
| `3b`      | **Pod Enters Running Phase**          | The moment the newly scheduled pod transitions from `Pending` to `Running`. This means the container has started executing.                           | Captures **image pulling, container startup latency**, and basic init overhead. |
| `3c`      | **Pod Becomes Ready**                 | The time when the pod passes all configured **readiness checks** and is marked as `Ready` in the cluster, eligible to serve traffic.                  | Indicates **application-level readiness**, critical for real workloads.         |
